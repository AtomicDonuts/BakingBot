# BakingBot Frequently Asked Questions
(actually no one ever asked this questions,but you could)
## Can using this bot be considered cheating?
I think "Speed Baking III" is based on luck rather than clicking very quickly or using optimal strategy, the only way to get it is to find a golden cookie "click frenzy" in the first 2, so I would say it is a legit way.
## The strategy the bot use is inefficient
The strategy used by the bot is not the best, it is the one I used when I tried to unlock the achievement. I'm more than sure there are better ones, feel free to submit it on me, I will pleased to implement it.
## Sometimes the bot ascend 2 times before start working
I noticed that sometime the game will not update the golden cookie "min" and "max" spawn time. Ascending 2 times fix the problem (normally you can fix it manually refreshing the page).
